- You can use tailwindcss or other CSS frameworks to style the website.

- The form should have the following fields:

- Don't forget to validate the form (all fields are required, email should be a valid email, zip code should be a number, etc...).

- Don't forget to sanitize the data (remove the spaces, remove the special characters, etc...).
